				<h1>Joycelyn Rooney</h1>
  				<p><img class="myphoto" src="images/picture.jpg" alt="me">Hello. My name is Joycelyn Rooney and this is my online resume. I just want you to know a little bit about myself before reading my resume. I am 22 years old and a senior at University of Central Florida. Although I go to school at UCF, my permanent home is in Cumming, Ga., which is a small town about 40 minutes north of Atlanta. But the town is growing larger and larger by the day. I have not always lived in Georgia though. I am originally from Fort Lauderdale, FL. I have been a Floridian for the majority of my life. I have an older brother, turning 24 soon who also graduated from UCF back in the summer 2015.

		  <p class="collegeinfo"><img class="ucfcrest" src="images/ucfcrest.png" alt="ucf">As I said above, I am a senior at UCF. I am planning on graduating December of 2017 with a Bachelors degree in Digital Media Web Design and a Minor in Marketing from the College of Arts and Humanities. Through my years in college, I have had many experiences other than just educational.</p>

		  <p class="collegeinfo">Back during my first summer term at UCF in 2013, I decided to joing the UCF Knights Wakeboard Club. Every Sunday we would pile up in someone's car and drive to Orlando Watersports Complex to practice. UCF's Wakeboard Club is a 2 time national Collegiate Cable champion in the country. I joined this club because it let me get my foot in the door or getting involved with UCF and meeting new people.</p>

		  <p class="collegeinfo">During my sophomore year, I decided to venture into Greek life at UCF. I went through the formal recruitment process and eventually ran home to the house of Kappa Kappa Gamma. I decided to join Greek life to help meet more people on campus, get involved with philanthropy both on campus and off campus, and help build my resume by taking on leadership positions. During my time in Greek life, I was a Rho Gamma during fall of 2016, which is someone who voluntarily and temporarily gives up their letters to help other girls find their home. Also, during the fall of 2016, I acted as Panhellenic Director for Pack to Attack. Pack to Attack is a UCF philanthropy that partners up with organization called Feeding Children Everywhere to pack meals and send them to local neighborhoods that cannot afford food.</p>
